title: What is tmam?
---

TMAM simplifies the AI development workflow, particularly for Generative AI and LLMs. It streamlines core tasks like LLM experimentation, prompt management and versioning, and secure API key handling. With a single line of code, developers can enable OpenTelemetry-native observability, gaining full-stack insights across LLMs, vector databases, and GPUs. This makes it easy to move confidently from prototyping to production.
TMAM actively follows and maintains OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions, staying up-to-date with the latest observability standards.
