This guide will help you set up OpenTelemetry Auto Instrumentation to monitor your LLM application using TMAM. In just a few steps, you'll be able to track and analyze the performance and usage of your LLM applications. We'll show you how to send OpenTelemetry traces and metrics from your applications directly to TMAM.


## Instructions
To get started, follow these steps:
<Stepper>
  <StepperItem title="Step 1: Install Python or Javascript SDK">
    Install Python SDK using pip:

    ```plaintext
    pip install TMAM-SDK
    ```
    or install Javascript SDK using pip:

    ```plaintext
    npm install TMAM-SDK
    ```
  </StepperItem>

  <StepperItem title="Step 2: Initialize TMAM in Your Application">
    After install the SDK, initate :

    ```plaintext
    import tmam

    tmam.init(
        url="http://api.tmam.ai/api/sdk/v1",
        public_key="pk-tmam-0edeba2a-f6f3-4efd-982c-412adbb03046",
        secrect_key="sk-tmam-b320dda9-e36d-4eac-8ac5-4793fd38e002",
    )
    # Your LLM or agent code here
    from openai import OpenAI
    # ...
    Once initialized, tmam will auto-instrument supported components and begin sending traces and metrics to TMAM’s backend.
    ```
  </StepperItem>

  <StepperItem title="Step 3: Visualize and Analyze">
    Install all necessary project dependencies with npm:

    <Note title="Remember">
      To support React 19, package maintainers will need to test and update their packages to include React 19 as a peer dependency. This is already in progress.
      <br/>
    </Note>

    ```plaintext
    npm install
    ```
  </StepperItem>

  <StepperItem title="Step 4: >
    Finally, start the development server to view the project locally:

    ```plaintext
    npm run dev
    ```
  </StepperItem>
</Stepper>

## Example

For a faster setup, use the `npx` command to create a new AriaDocs project in one step:

```plaintext
npx create-aria-doc <project-directory>
```

**Command Output:**

```plaintext
Creating a new AriaDocs project in /path/to/your/project from the master branch...
Cloning Master (Full Documentation)...
AriaDocs project successfully created in /path/to/your/project!

Next steps:
1. Navigate to your project directory:
   cd <project-directory>
2. Install dependencies:
   npm install
3. Start the development server:
   npm run dev
```

With this setup, you’ll have a ready-to-use AriaDocs instance to start building your documentation.
